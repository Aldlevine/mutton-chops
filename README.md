[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Aldlevine/mutton-chops.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Aldlevine/mutton-chops)

This is currently under construction and extremely __unusable!__
However, if you're interested, up to date documentation of current progress can be found [here](http://aldlevine.github.io/mutton-chops/).
